Aipnp, AirPlane and Pilot, is an Airbnb inspired app that allows aircraft owners to offset the costs of ownership by renting their plane out when they aren't flying it, and It allows general aviation, normally a very expensive hobby, to be more financially feasable for non-owners. In the future, the costs of renting out aircraft could be greatly reduced by usilising an algorythm that takes in a plane's destination, home airport, and time of availibility, and makes sure that aircraft is rented in such away that it returns home or close to home when the aircraft's avalability window comes to an end. The will all but eleminated deadheading, one of the single biggest money wasters in renting aircraft.
